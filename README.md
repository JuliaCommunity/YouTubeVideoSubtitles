# YouTubeVideoSubtitles
Community sources subtitles for videos on the Julia Languages YouTube channel

## Getting Started

This guide will help you update the subtitles on one of the Julia Languages YouTube videos. Please follow the steps below

## Creating timestamps

1) Head to https://amara.org/en/videos/create/ and create an account (one time step)
2) Enter your workspace: https://amara.org/en/workspace/
3) Add the link to a video which has subtitles which were auto-generated incorrectly then click "Add Video(s)" and select the language spoken in the video (likely English). Click "Add to Amara Public"

Your screen should now look something like this:

4) The next step is to click the three dots next to the "Add/Edit subtitles button" and then "upload subtitles".
5) Open a new tab and navigate to https://toolbxs.com/downloader/youtube_subtitle/ (__there may be annoying on screen ads/popups, we apologize for this__)
6) Paste in the link to the YouTube video you want to update.
7) Click "Submit" on the right side and then scroll down to "Download TXT". Save the file somewhere that you can easily access it. 
8) After you download the file, go back to Amara where your screen should look like the below image, and select the subtitles you downloaded.

9) Complete the upload. Then, when taken back to the Amara page, click "Incomplete subtitles, English [en]"
10) Click "Edit subtitles". 
11) Follow the onscreen prompts to edit the subtitles through the Amara interface.
12) You will likely need to edit the subtitles length (less than 42 characters per line) in the middle section of the Amara page. Note: Shift + Return on Amara is the same as a normal return outside of Amara.

When you are done, you can save and publish the subtitles here via opening a new issue and pasting the link. Those will then be manually uploaded to YouTube. Thank you for your contribution!
